#JCC2 Theme... originally JCC2 Theme

Now working for JCC5...

Both themes in this folder need to be installed. We are set up as a child theme of thematic, whatever version is in here... so it's important to keep it in version control. Plus it's wordpress... so really anything goes. FREE FOR ALL.

Anyway, some modifications here to make it slightly better while we wait for the redesign.
